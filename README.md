Contributing
------------

I want this to become a truly awesome resource. Devs should be able to take a look and choose a great resource without googling for hours.

* If you have any suggestions on how to make this better, open an issue. 
* If you have a resource to contribute, make a pull request.
	Please just use `add resource.com` in your commit message. 
* Please keep the format in alphabetical order. 
	* In vim: Select the lines to be sorted in "Visual Line" mode with `Shift + V` and invoke the "sort" function with `:sort`.
	* In SublimeText: Just select the lines to be sorted and hit F5. 

Please make sure the provider isn't some EvilCorp™ that'll send nice letters with a hefty price tag through their attorneys later on.
